    // rules and uses the number's storage as ordinary bits.

    // Reader exercise:
    //
    // The IEEE-754 format for `f32` numbers separates them into three parts:
    //
    // 1. The sign marks whether the number is positive or negative: 1 bit
    // 2. The exponent marks how far from zero the number is: 8 bits
    // 3. The fraction describes the number: 23 bits.
    //
    // Using these widths (1 bit, 8 bits, 23 bits), the knowledge that
    // `&BitSlice` is a normal Rust slice, and the API documentation for
    // `std::iter::Iterator`, see if you can display each portion of an `f32`
    // as its own row.
    //
    // Hints:
    //
    // - The variable `bits` is set up to view the entire number, from most
    // significant bit to least.
    // - You can get access to a structure that performs iteration by calling
    //   `bits.iter()`.
    // - You can use the `Iterator::by_ref` method to prevent `Iterator` adapter
    //   functions from destroying the source iterator.
    // - `&BitSlice` is an ordinary Rust slice, so you can use `[start .. end]`
    //   range indexing to get smaller pieces of it.
