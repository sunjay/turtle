//! View bits in memory with turtles

//! You are encouraged to change both the data used to seed the turtle, and the

    // `bitvec` can look at more than just `u8`. Let's try looking at the bits
    // that represent a number!
    //
    // Some numbers, like `f64`, have special rules for their representation in
    // bits. `bitvec` only knows about raw bits, so it does not provide direct
    // support for `f64`. Rust lets us get the bit representation from an `f64`
    // with the method `to_bits(f64) -> u64`, which forgets about the `f64`
    // rules and uses the number's storage as ordinary bits.
    //
    // You can read more about the rules for `f64`'s storage in memory, and
    // behavior in programs, here:
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format
    let raw_number: u64 = NUMBER.to_bits();

    // `bitvec` can also view bits from left to right, with `BigEndian`.
    let bits: &BitSlice<_, _> = raw_number.bits::<BigEndian>();

    // Since we are reading bits from left to right, the turtle should move from
    // left to right also. You can change the `* 2.0` to move the section
    // horizontally.
    let left_edge = -right_edge * 2.0;
    turtle.set_x(left_edge);
    // Walk from left to right
    turtle.set_heading(0.0);

    // The `&BitSlice` type acts just like `&[bool]`, so it comes with a
    // `.chunks` method which divides it into smaller pieces. `bitvec` can take
    // any number, not just multiples of 8, but 16 is a convenient number to
    // look at. Try changing it to a different number, like 10, to see what
    // happens!
    for (num, row) in bits.chunks(16).enumerate() {
        println!("Row {} bits: {:b}", num, row);
        // Each chunk produced is a smaller `&BitSlice`, just like
        // `&[bool].chunks` produces smaller `&[bool]`s, so we can draw it.
        draw_row(&mut turtle, row);
        // After each row, the turtle has to go back to the left edge.
        turtle.set_x(left_edge);
    }

    // Reader exercise:
    //
    // The IEEE-754 format for `f64` numbers separates them into three parts:
    //
    // 1. The sign marks whether the number is positive or negative: 1 bit
    // 2. The exponent marks how far from zero the number is: 11 bits
    // 3. The fraction describes the number: 52 bits.
    //
    // Using these widths (1 bit, 11 bits, 52 bits), the knowledge that
    // `&BitSlice` is a normal Rust slice, and the API documentation for
    // `std::iter::Iterator`, see if you can display each portion of an `f64`
    // as its own row.
    //
    // Hints:
    //
    // - The variable `bits` is set up to view the entire number, from most
    // significant bit to least.
    // - You can get access to a structure that performs iteration by calling
    //   `bits.iter()`.
    // - You can use the `Iterator::by_ref` method to prevent `Iterator` adapter
    //   functions from destroying the source iterator.
    // - `&BitSlice` is an ordinary Rust slice, so you can use `[start .. end]`
    //   range indexing to get smaller pieces of it.
