//! This example draws star shapes.
//!
//! A star is a circle divided into points, and points are connected across the
//! interior of the circle, instead of to their neighbors.
//!
//! Imagine a five-pointed star. It is made by dividing a circle into five
//! points, and then connecting each point to its neighbors *two* steps away
//! instead of *one*. Connecting each point to its immediate neighbors draws a
//! pentagon, but connecting each point to farther neighbors draws a star.
//!
//! This relationship is true for many different numbers of points, and
//! distances between them. If we divide a circle into some number of points,
//! and pick a number of points around the circle to skip before drawing
//! connecting lines, we can draw all kinds of stars, and see the relationship
//! between the skip count, the point count, and the shape of the produced star.
