//! Draw the officially unofficial Rust mascot.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! This example draws a happy Ferris, the Rust language mascot. The original
//! image was taken from the Rust community website [rustacean.net].
//!
//! # Implementation details
//!
//! As the image is quite curvy, building arcs by hand would have been awful.
//! So this example uses a [cubic Bézier curve] implementation extensively.
//! It does it by first using [GIMP] in order to measure each curve's cubic
//! parameters and simply paste them in the drawing code. Those are "unadapted"
//! points because the original and actual drawing aspect ratios are not
//! necessarily the same. So they are first "adapted" by distorting the space.
//! They are also absolute points because using them directly would not take
//! into account the current position of the turtle. So they are then transformed
//! into relative points. Finally, the current position is added into the mix in
//! order to get absolute points back and draw the cubic Bézier curve simply by
//! applying the formula. Some linear movements are of course used as well.
//!
//! As one can see, there has been a great deal of effort put into making the
//! drawing as independent as possible of the canvas size. Although it worked
//! fine for the first parts of the drawing, it does not for the shell spikes
//! unfortunately. This is because measuring curve parameters takes a long time,
//! so to avoid that, a simple loop is used to draw the spikes. For them to be
//! drawn correctly however, a rotation of the Bézier points had to be implemented,
//! otherwise the crab would be flat. The ratio adaptation could not be added
//! in the rotation, so resizing the canvas results in chaos sadly.
//!
//! Solutions to fix this could be:
//!  * Finding a way to adapt rotated adapted relative points.
//!  * Using elliptic arcs for the spike tip parts, which would be convenient
//!    to adapt.
//!  * Removing all the ratio adaptation, replacing it with size adaptation and
//!    using a canvas size with the same aspect ratio as the original image.
//!
//! Any contribution or suggestion towards this is welcome!
