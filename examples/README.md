# Examples

The examples in this directory are meant to help teach you about different
aspects of the turtle library. Each example shows a different way of using the
library to create a drawing. Examples range from "beginner" to "advanced". Even
if you don't feel like you're advanced enough yet, it may be worthwhile to read
and try to understand how some of the advanced examples work. Some examples are
more advanced than others. The following are some of the most prominent examples
which you should take a look at.

## Level: Beginner

## Level: Intermediate

## Level: Advanced

In this example, the turtle generates and draws a maze. Then it goes through
and solves the maze by moving through the passages until it finds the exit.
