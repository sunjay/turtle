# Examples

The examples in this directory are meant to help teach you about different
aspects of the turtle library. Each example shows a different way of using the
library to create a drawing. Examples range from "beginner" to "advanced". Even
if you don't feel like you're advanced enough yet, it may be worthwhile to read
and try to understand how some of the advanced examples work. Some examples are
more advanced than others. The following are some of the most prominent examples
which you should take a look at.

## Level: Beginner
### Simple Square

![square](../docs/assets/images/examples/square.gif)

**Source Code**: [square.rs](square.rs)

This is almost the simplest turtle program possible: it draws a non-centered
square on the canvas by repeating the two basic `forward` and `right` methods.

### Simple Circle

![circle](../docs/assets/images/examples/circle.gif)

**Source Code**: [circle.rs](circle.rs)

The circle is usually the next step after simple geometric shapes like polygons
because of its apparent simplicity. There is a catch though: a turtle may only
turn in place or go in a straight line. So then we have to decompose the circle
into small lines and turns in order to obtain a regular polygon with just a lot
of sides so that it looks like a circle.

### Dashed Circle

![dashed_circle](../docs/assets/images/examples/dashed_circle.gif)

**Source Code**: [dashed_circle.rs](dashed_circle.rs)

This one is just a variant of the previous showcasing the ability to raise or
lower the drawing pen using the `pen_up` and `pen_down` turtle methods.

### Radioactive Triangles

![three-triangles](../docs/assets/images/examples/three-triangles.gif)

**Source Code**: [three-triangles.rs](three-triangles.rs)

Shows how a simple operation like drawing an equilateral triangle can be repeated
in order to get a more complex result.

### Five Branch Star

![empty_star](../docs/assets/images/examples/empty_star.gif)

**Source Code**: [empty_star.rs](empty_star.rs)

Simple five branch star with an empty middle that colors the background and the
pen with a thicker pen size as well, using respectively the `set_background_color`,
`set_pen_color` and `set_pen_size` turtle methods.

## Level: Intermediate
### Color-filled Squares Spiral

![squares](../docs/assets/images/examples/squares.gif)

**Source Code**: [squares.rs](squares.rs)

This is a repetition of the square drawing, but with added colors and an inner
colored fill using the `set_fill_color`, `begin_fill` and `end_fill` methods.

### Isometric Nested Cubes

![nestedcubes](../docs/assets/images/examples/nestedcubes.gif)

**Source Code**: [nestedcubes.rs](nestedcubes.rs)

This one is quite interesting: it draws a hexagonal spiral with a regularly
fading color until it makes it go back to the original one, but it slowly
reveals a form of visual illusion showing nested concentric three-dimensional
cubes isometrically projected onto the two-dimensional space of the canvas.

### Randomly-colored Tornado

![coloredridge](../docs/assets/images/examples/coloredridge.gif)

**Source Code**: [coloredridge.rs](coloredridge.rs)

This color frenzy is also nice to look at: the regular shape is generated using
a gaussian function setting the pen size.

### Heart Emoji

![heart](../docs/assets/images/examples/heart.gif)

**Source Code**: [heart.rs](heart.rs)

Cute heart. The arcs are not as easy to draw as one could imagine at first.

### Rust Logo

![rust](../docs/assets/images/examples/rust.gif)

**Source Code**: [rust.rs](rust.rs)

The - approximate - Rust language logo using this crate!

### Snowman

![snowman](../docs/assets/images/examples/snowman.gif)

**Source Code**: [snowman.rs](snowman.rs)

A nice-looking snowman with all its common features.

### Turtle

![draw_turtle](../docs/assets/images/examples/draw_turtle.gif)

**Source Code**: [draw_turtle.rs](draw_turtle.rs)

A turtle drawn by... a turtle!

## Level: Advanced
### Heighway Dragon Curve

![dragon](../docs/assets/images/examples/dragon.gif)

**Source Code**: [dragon.rs](dragon.rs)

Draws a [Heighway dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve).
Such a self-similar fractal curve is generated by recursively unfolding a line
by 90°: step 1 is a simple segment, step 2 is duplicating step 1's segment and
rotating it by 90° along one of its extremities, which makes a new extremity:
repeat the process using this one in order to generate the next step.

### Square Fractal Tree

![tree](../docs/assets/images/examples/tree.gif)

**Source Code**: [tree.rs](tree.rs)

Another tree-like fractal curve where the trunks or branches are squares rather
than lines, with sizes chosen to make two squares' vertices coincide.

### Von Koch Snowflake

![snowflake](../docs/assets/images/examples/snowflake.gif)

**Source Code**: [snowflake.rs](snowflake.rs)

Draws a [Von Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake). This
uses yet another recursive algorithm: step 1 is an equilateral triangle, step 2
is cutting each of its sides in three and replaces their middle parts with an
equilateral triangle of adequate size but without a base side, step n + 1 is
repeating the process for each side of step n.

### Random Maze Generator + Solver

![maze](../docs/assets/images/examples/maze.gif)

**Source Code**: [maze/main.rs](maze/main.rs)

In this example, the turtle generates and draws a maze. Then it goes through
and solves the maze by moving through the passages until it finds the exit.
