    /// look at it. If you do not check for events continuously, there is a chance that the events
    /// you ask for from `poll_event()` will be outdated.

    /// Even if you do not use every kind of event, you should aim to poll events using this method
    /// until there are none left to poll. If you do not poll events for a significant amount of
    /// time during your application, favor the events that come later as you poll since those will
    /// be the most recent. This can happen if you run many animations between loop iterations.

    /// moment. If it suits your purposes, you may also just use a single loop to handle events
