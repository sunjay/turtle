/// # Accessing The Drawing
///
/// The most common way to create a new drawing is implicitly through the [`Turtle::new()`] method.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use turtle::*;
/// let mut turtle = Turtle::new();
/// ```
///
/// That method returns a new [`Turtle`] and allows you to begin drawing right away, but doesn't
/// provide the ability to manipulate the properties of the drawing you are creating.
///
/// To get access to those properties, you need to change the way you create your turtle to match
/// the following:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use turtle::*;
/// let mut drawing = Drawing::new();
/// let mut turtle = drawing.add_turtle();
///
/// // Now you can set properties on the drawing
/// drawing.set_title("Really cool picture!");
/// // You can also draw things using the turtle you created
/// turtle.forward(100.0);
/// ```
///
/// This creates a new [`Drawing`], and then adds a turtle using the [`add_turtle()`] method.
///
/// It is usually **incorrect** to call both [`Drawing::new()`] and [`Turtle::new()`]. Each of
/// those methods creates a new window. You can only draw on a drawing with turtles created using
/// the [`add_turtle()`] method on that drawing.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use turtle::*;
/// let mut drawing = Drawing::new();
/// let mut turtle = Turtle::new(); // <-- This is probably **incorrect**
