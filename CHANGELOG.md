and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* New `new` and `add_turtle` methods on `Drawing` allow you to create a drawing
  and a turtle at the center of it
  * This API will eventually enable us to have support for multiple turtles
    drawing at the same time
* First few pages of the new guide have been published on https://turtle.rs/guide

### Changed

* The recommended way to add the turtle crate to your `Cargo.toml` file has
  changed to include `opt-level = 3` for dependencies only. This is necessary
  because debug performance of turtle and other crates is not very good. This
  change increases the initial build time for any application using the turtle
  crate as a dependency, but should not affect incremental builds after that.
  See the [docs] or the [guide] for more detailed instructions.
  ```toml
  [profile.dev.package."*"]
  opt-level = 3
  ```
* Closing the window no longer calls `process::exit`. That means that you can
  create multiple windows which can be closed independently. If you continue to
  use a turtle after the window has closed, the thread will panic since there is
  no where to continue drawing the picture. This panic stops the current thread,
  but is not necessarily an "error". Make sure to use `turtle::start()` if you
  plan to call `Turtle::new()` or `Drawing::new()` in a separate thread.
* The `Event` enum has changed considerably now that we've moved to glutin, but
  most of the same events are still available with minor changes to existing code
* `Event` and some of its related enums are now marked [`#[non_exhaustive]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/type_system.html#the-non_exhaustive-attribute).
  That means that we will be able to add further variants in the future if
  needed without it being a breaking change.
* `Event` and its related enums are now entirely part of the turtle crate. We no
  longer re-export parts of the `piston_window` crate (and in fact do not rely
  on `piston_window` at all anymore).
* The `event` module, `Event`, and all related enums are now unstable and you
  need to use the `unstable` feature in your `Cargo.toml` to enable them. These
  may change as we figure out what event handling should look like in the turtle
  crate.
* The pen used by the turtle is now circular and has circular ends at higher pen
  thicknesses. This matches the behaviour of the Python turtle module and is
  useful for being able to smoothly draw curves and circles using the turtle crate.
* The `save_svg` method on `Drawing` returns a `Result` type now
* The `set_pen_size` method no doubles the given thickness value
  * This means that you may have to adjust your program to set the pen thickness
    to double the value you were setting previously
* The `Speed` levels change the amount of time it takes to draw something linearly
  * This may change again in the future as we decide how to best use the different
    speed levels
* The `set_fill_color` method updates the currently filling shape, even after
  `begin_fill` has been called
  * Previously, you could only set the fill color *before* `begin_fill` was called
* The bits example in `examples/bits.rs` has been updated to bitvec 0.17

### Removed

* `drawing` and `drawing_mut` methods have been removed due to soundness issues
  that these methods would introduce when multiple turtle support is added.
  Use `Drawing::new()` and `drawing.add_turtle()` instead to get access to the
  drawing.

### Fixed

* [#30](https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/issues/30) - **potentially breaking:**
  fill polygons now start at the current position when `begin_fill()` is called.
  We previously had a bug where we would start at the end of the next line after
  `begin_fill()` was called.

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2019-12-11
