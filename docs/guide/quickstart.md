If you already know Rust, and you have Rust and Cargo installed already, you can
immediately get started by performing the following steps:

1. (optional) Create a new Rust project
    ```bash
    cargo new --bin <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>
    cd <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>
    ```
2. Add turtle as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    turtle = "{{ site.data.lib.latest.version }}"
    ```
3. Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following:
    ```rust
    use turtle::Turtle;

    fn main() {
        let mut turtle = Turtle::new();

        for _ in 0..360 {
            // Move forward three steps
            turtle.forward(3.0);
            // Rotate to the right (clockwise) by 1 degree
            turtle.right(1.0);
        }
    }
    ```
4. Run the code with `cargo run`. You should see a window pop up and a circle
   being drawn.
   ![turtle rust circle]({% link assets/images/docs/getting-started/circle.gif %})

If the instructions above made sense to you and worked, you can move on to the
next part of this guide. The rest of this page explains everything in much more
detail.

## Installing Rust

**Note:** If you already have a recent version of Rust and Cargo installed,
you can skip this section.

1. Go to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Follow the instructions on that page to install Rust
3. Open your terminal or command prompt, and check that you have the right
   version with the following command:
   ```bash
   $ rustc -V
   rustc 1.38.0 (625451e37 2019-09-23)
   ```
   Your version should be greater than or equal to the one shown on this page.

## Starting a New Rust Project

**Note:** If you already have a Rust project created, you can skip this section.
However, if you're new to Rust, you may want to read this anyway.

Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
$ cargo new --bin <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>
$ cd <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>
```

You should choose the name you want to use for this project and write it instead
of `<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>` in these commands and any that follow. The first
command will create a new directory with the name `<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>`. Inside
that directory will be everything you need to start writing Rust. The second
command will enter that directory so you can run the remaining commands on this
page.

The `<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>` directory should look like the following:
```
<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

You will write Rust code in `.rs` files in the `src/` directory. The
`Cargo.toml` file is a configuration file for the Rust build system. The build
system, known as Cargo, makes it easy to add libraries like Turtle to your
project.

You can build and run your entire project with just a single command:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

This should produce something similar to the following output:
```
Compiling <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME> v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38 secs
     Running `target/debug/<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>`
Hello, world!
```

Your project directory will now look something like the following:
```
<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
└── target
    └── ...several directories and files...
```

The new `Cargo.lock` file will ensure that any dependencies you add (see the
next section) will remain the same regardless of how many times you build so
that your build is reproducible on any computer. The `target/` directory
contains the files generated by Cargo during the build.

The `cargo run` command will be enough to compile and run the Rust applications
you make with this crate. Any time we ask you to run your project, this is the
command you should use.

## Adding Turtle as a Dependency

In Rust, we share pieces of code by packing them up into "crates". We call them
crates because our packaging and build system is named Cargo. You may see the
same concept referred to as a "library" or "package" in other programming
languages. The Turtle crate gives you the ability to create animated pictures.
There are many other crates available on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/){:target="_blank"} that you can use in your
application in addition to this one.

When you add a crate to your project, it is known as a "dependency" of your
project because your project *depends* on it in order to run. Cargo will
automatically download and build any dependencies that you add to your project
when you run a command like `cargo run`.

In this section, we will tell Cargo that we want to use the Turtle crate in our
project. Cargo will then download the crate for us and build it without us
having to take any extra steps.

To start, find the `Cargo.toml` file in the top-level directory of your Rust
project. Add the following to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
turtle = "^{{ site.data.lib.latest.version }}"
```

The dependencies section may already exist in Cargo.toml. Make sure you don't
add it twice!

Then, add the following to the top of `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use turtle::Turtle;
```

The line that starts with `fn main()` declares a "function" called `main`. A
function is a group of lines of code that we want the computer to run. The
`main` function is special because that is the first "block" of code that the
computer will run. The contents of the function between the two curly braces
`{...}` is known as the "body" of the function.

Replace the body of the function so that the entire main function looks as
follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut turtle = Turtle::new();

    for _ in 0..360 {
        // Move forward three steps
        turtle.forward(3.0);
        // Rotate to the right (clockwise) by 1 degree
        turtle.right(1.0);
    }
}
```

When you're finished, `src/main.rs` should look as follows:

```rust
use turtle::Turtle;

fn main() {
    let mut turtle = Turtle::new();

    for _ in 0..360 {
        // Move forward three steps
        turtle.forward(3.0);
        // Rotate to the right (clockwise) by 1 degree
        turtle.right(1.0);
    }
}
```

To run this code, run `cargo run` as you did above. You must be in the same
directory as your `Cargo.toml` file in order to run that command.

This time, you'll see Cargo downloading and compiling the Turtle crate, as well
as any other crates that the Turtle crate depends on. Cargo will build all of
these for your operating system automatically without you having to take any
additional steps. Once it is done, it will run your code. **This process may
take a few minutes the first time, but should be very fast from then on.**

Once Cargo has built and run your code, you should see a window pop up and
produce the following:

![turtle rust circle]({% link assets/images/docs/getting-started/circle.gif %})

**You just wrote some Rust code and drew your first picture with the Turtle
crate!** You're now ready to go on to the next lessons and learn about this
code and how you can create even more advanced drawings!
