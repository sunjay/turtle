So far, we've only been generating drawings with straight lined shapes. This
lesson will cover how we can use turtle to draw curves and circles.

- The trick: if we keep drawing smaller and smaller curved lines, we can get
  something that is indistinguishable from an actual curve
- Show variations of a curve with more lines that become smaller and smaller
- Curvy lines via very small steps and rotation
- Curve -> circle
- To draw a quarter of a circle, you need to go 90 degrees - explain why visually
- Go over code from circle example

## Exercises

These exercises are designed to help you reinforce what you've learned
throughout this lesson. All exercises are completely **optional**. If you get
stuck on an exercise, it is totally okay to move on and come back to it later.

If you need help, see the [Getting Help] section of the guide.

- (*) change radius of circle
- (*) change angle to something bigger or smaller without changing anything
  else and see what happens
- (**) draw a circle backwards
- (**) draw two circles side by side
- (**) draw half of a circle on the left and the other half on the right (s-curve)
- (***) draw a flower of s-curves
- (***) draw a flower with circular petals with a stem
- (***) draw a flower with oval petals with a stem and oval leaves
  - Bonus: color the flower with [`begin_fill`] and [`end_fill`]
- (***) circle with dashed lines
  - use [`pen_up`] and [`pen_down`]
