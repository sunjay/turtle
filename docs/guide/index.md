## Welcome to Turtle!

This crate will allow you to draw animated pictures with the Rust programming
language.

**This documentation is still being written. Many of the navigation links on the
left will not work or may break in the future.**

In the meantime, the following resources should help you learn what you need:

* [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/){:target="_blank"} - If you are new to the Rust programming language
* [Turtle Examples](https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/tree/master/examples){:target="_blank"} - Creative examples of how to use the crate for drawing things from basic shapes to colorful masterpieces, and even the logo of the Rust programming language!
  * **How you can help:** Create and contribute examples! Open a PR on the Turtle
    GitHub repository so we can add your example to the repository!
* [The Turtle API Documentation](https://docs.rs/turtle){:target="_blank"} - The drawing
  functions and most of the rest of the crate is well documented
  * **How you can help:** Add examples and better descriptions to anything you
    think could use some more documentation

To start using Turtle, follow the instructions in the
[**Getting Started**]({% link guide/getting-started.md %}) section.

## Introduction to Programming

This section will answer the questions:

* Why do we program?
* What is a programming language and why do we need it?
* What can we do with a programming language?
* What is Rust? Why should I learn Rust?

The reason we program is so that we can get the computer to do something.
Computers don't do anything on their own. Someone must give the computer
**instructions** in order for anything to be executed. Our operating system
(Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, Android, etc.) is just one big **program** full of
instructions. These instructions are not written in English, French, Spanish,
or any other human language. Instead, machines use something called **machine
language**. This is a special
