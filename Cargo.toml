# Since the debug performance of turtle isn't all that great, we recommend that
# every user of turtle add the following to their Cargo.toml
#
#     [profile.dev.package."*"]
#     opt-level = 3
#
# This increases initial compile time a bit, but after that the library will
# always work performantly even if the user's code itself is in debug mode still
#
# The following setting mimics that for the debug build of this crate.
# We don't use `.package."*"` because the turtle crate *is* the package that
# would be optimized with that setting in an application that uses this crate.

[features]
# The reason we do this is because doctests don't get cfg(test)
# See: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4669
#
# This allows us to write attributes like the following and have it work
# in all tests.
#
# #[cfg(any(feature = "test", test))]
#
# NOTE: This means that tests MUST be run with:
#   cargo test --features "test"
test = []

# Feature flag to disable unstable features by default.
#
# Users of the crate must explicitly opt-in to activate them.
