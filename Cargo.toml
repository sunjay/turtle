[features]
# The reason we do this is because doctests don't get cfg(test)
# See: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4669
#
# This allows us to write attributes like the following and have it work
# in all tests.
#
# #[cfg(any(feature = "test", test))]
#
# NOTE: This means that tests MUST be run with:
#   cargo test --features "test"
test = []

# Feature flag to disable unstable features by default and make consumers explicitly activate them.
